Advancing Healthcare in India Through a Centralized Medical Record System


# Problem Statement
Inefficient information management in India's healthcare system leads to fragmented patient data, limited provider coordination, compromised patient safety, and a dearth of evidence-based decision-making.
This calls for more efficient data-accessing methods which can be accessed anytime and by any medical professional at the time of need by advancing the existing healthcare system in India.

# Solution

As citizens of India, it is mandatory for every individual to have a unique identification number which is the Aadhar UID. Since the Aadhar UID plays a very important role in linking an individual's bank account or the PAN card, we propse to integerate the Aadhar UID with the medical history of a person which can be accessed by the hospitals.

However, as Aadhar details of any induvidual are confidential, a two-factor authentication will ensure that the patient details are in safe hands. 
Not only will the patient be given verification privilege, but the registerd doctor in the hospital is also verified before consulting the patient. 
This way, we can ensure that both the parties are verified and consent has been given to access the details.
